# Fast Research-level Engineering with Torch

Or a simplified version of [PyTorch-lightening](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

But enough for quick research-level prototyping. 

Components
* FT model 
  * Normal pytorch model 
  * Integrated optimizer
  * Training, validation, and evaluation wrapper
* A controller 
  * Training 
    * Logging
    * Checkpointing/ Saving 
  * Evaluation 
    * Loading
